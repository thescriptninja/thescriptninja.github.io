			<p>In 2020, the amount of time I spent on the internet was probably the highest I have in any previous year and I have consumed a near-unhealthy amount of digital content while being at home for long periods. I thought it would be nice to look back. This is inspired by a recent <a href="https://www.xypnox.com/blag/posts/culture-2020/">blogpost</a> by <a href="https://www.xypnox.com">@xypnox</a>.</p>
<h2 id="literature">Literature</h2>
<p>I read regularly before joining college, but because of involvements on campus and other things to explore, I didn’t read as much as I used to. Without the usual activities on campus, I found more time to read. The guilt of having an unused Kindle lying around at home also contributed ;). Here are some books and pieces of literature I read and liked this year.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Siddhartha</strong> by Herman Hesse</li>
<li><strong>The Stranger</strong> by Albert Camus</li>
<li><strong>The Plague</strong> by Albert Camus (somewhat relatable :P)</li>
<li><strong>Fooled by Randomness</strong> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</li>
<li><strong>Sapiens</strong> by Yuval Noah Harari</li>
<li><strong>Apollo’s Arrow</strong> by Nicholas Christakis (a very informative book about COVID-19)</li>
<li><strong>Norwegian Wood</strong> by Haruki Murakami</li>
<li><strong>Men without Women</strong> by Haruki Murakami</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44">This podcast episode</a> shifted my approach towards reading from compulsively trying to finish a book regardless of how I find it to only caring about the value I extract from the book. I started caring less about the number of books I read to completion, which I realized was simply a vanity metric, and more about the value I could extract from the book. This, coupled with selecting books based on personal recommendations saved a lot of time and I think I read a greater number of good books.
A great habit I formed was to read a book (a physical one, not an ebook) before bed for at least 15 mins. I found that this really improved sleep quality.</p>
<h2 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h2>
<p>(Not ranked)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bojack Horseman</strong> -  This show was hard-hitting. Wit and humor coupled with its dark theme made it a joy to watch. <em>Bojack</em> ended in 2020 and it will probably remain one of the best TV shows I have watched ever.</li>
<li><strong>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</strong> - Jerry Seinfeld’s wit even made it worth watching the episodes that had comedians I hadn’t heard of before. I also discovered many great comedians on this show.</li>
<li><strong>Sex Education</strong> - Goofy, funny, and heartfelt at times. A must watch.</li>
<li><strong>Seinfeld</strong> - Classic. Seinfeld episodes were saviors in depressing days.</li>
<li><strong>The Queen’s Gambit</strong> - No words required. Absolutely amazing even for someone who knows very little about chess.</li>
<li><strong>One Punch Man</strong> - While I am not an anime fan, I really liked this one. There is a cleverly hidden and thoughtful message that is conveyed under the funny and action-packed story.</li>
<li><strong>The Last Dance</strong> - Another great limited series that I enjoyed without knowing much about the topic.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p>(Not ranked)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parasite</strong></li>
<li><strong>Okja</strong> - an underrated film by Bong Joon-Ho.</li>
<li><strong>Bao</strong> - a beautiful animated short film by Pixar.</li>
<li><strong>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Truman Show</strong></li>
<li><strong>Her</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dallas Buyer’s Club</strong> - absolutely beautiful</li>
<li><strong>The Two Popes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Primal Fear</strong> - insanely good, must watch!</li>
<li><strong>The Departed</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="comedy">Comedy</h2>
<p>I created a separate section for this because I have totally binged Netflix comedy specials in lockdown to beat the stress of the online semester. Some great ones:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sebastian Maniscalco</strong> - all three of his specials are absolutely hilarious</li>
<li><strong>Dave Chappelle</strong>: Sticks and Stones - legendary</li>
<li><strong>Chris Rock</strong>: Tambourine</li>
<li><strong>Jerry Seinfeld</strong>: 23 hours to Kill</li>
<li><strong>Seth Meyers</strong>: Lobby Baby - insanely good</li>
<li><strong>Anthony Jeselnick</strong>: Fire in the maternity ward - unbelievably witty and dark.</li>
<li><strong>Trevor Noah</strong>: Son of Patricia</li>
<li><strong>Mike Birbiglia</strong>: My girlfriend’s boyfriend</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I have totally fallen in love with Classic Rock and indie rock. Since it will be quite tedious to name all the interesting music I have found, I’ll name some artists I enjoy.</p>
<p>Some all-time favorites- Led Zeppelin, John Mayer, Dire Straits, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Tom Petty, Credence Clearwater Revival.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
