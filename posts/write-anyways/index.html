			<p>Whenever I think of writing anything on my blog, I immediately start judging the worth of what I am about to write. For a long time, I believed that writing was worth it only if I had something new to offer. Under this belief, I shied away from writing about things and ideas that I had learned about, knowing that there was someone who had already written about them more lucidly and comprehensively than I ever could.</p>
<p>Lately, I have experienced an advantage of writing that offsets this need for originality.</p>
<p>Writing about a topic is like applying the <a href="https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/">Feynman technique</a>. In my mind, I am forgiving of the gaps in my knowledge. Soon after I start to write about a topic, I realise how little I know about it. It becomes apparent that whatever knowledge I have acquired is superficial at best. There are a lot of faults and inconsistencies in my understanding, which I immediately imagine a reader pointing out. In the end, it comes down to about being confident enough in your knowledge to be able to teach it to someone who knows nothing about it.</p>
<p>An advantage of publishing your writing lies in throwing yourself open to criticism and judgement. The pressure of writing something bulletproof motivates you towards learning more about it.</p>
<p>An approach that I find useful is to simplify what I am writing as much as possible. The topic at hand must be distilled to its fundamentals and built up from there. If I can explain something in simple terms, I know that I have really understood it.</p>
<p>A better way to look at the blog would be as a public notebook, or a log of my learning journey.</p>
<p>Hope to write more with this mindset :)</p>
