				<p>The events of the last 24 hours have been unexpected, unthinkable, unimaginable, unbelievable and most of all undesirable. I have found out just how unlucky and lucky I can get on the same day. So here goes my frustrating travelogue.</p>
<p>The exams were finally over and after a long and exhausting semester of 4 months, I was finally going home. Me and two of my friends were to be travelling together from KGP to Kolkata by cab to catch a 10:00 PM flight to Pune. Hauling ourselves onto the plane was the only task at hand.</p>
<p>The troubles start here - On the morning of the day of departure, we found out that the airport was to be closed from 9:00 PM. Why, you ask?</p>
<p>Enter the antagonist of this story - Cyclone Fani. A super cyclone with predicted wind speeds of 200 km/hr was about to hit the eastern coast of India with all its rage and fury. We knew about this before but hardly realised the severity of it. The news of the closing of the airport came as a shock, and that too at 5:00 AM. We were thrown into a hustle and somehow we rescheduled the flight to 4:40 PM. Heaving a sigh of relief, we packed, hurriedly had breakfast and left immediately. We were in high spirits, having averted an inconvenience and the conversation on the car was lively - about the foregone semester and plans for the vacation.</p>
<p>Our happiness was to be short lived - one of my friends checked the flight status after about an hour along the way, only to find out that all flights had been grounded because of the cyclone until the next day. It was one of those moments when you are numb with shock and your mind goes blank for a few seconds. We couldn’t turn back, we were too far along the way and we couldn’t think what to do in Kolkata. Trains were also cancelled. I still remember the distraught expressions of my friends and suspect that I was also carrying a similar one on my countenance. We debated whether to go to the airport to check what was happening or go to our friend’s house in Kolkata and catch a flight the next day. There seemed no point in going to the airport as all flights were cancelled, but at the same time there was no harm in checking. Each of my friends supported opposite decisions and the final call was left upto me. The debate was consuming a lot of time and we were fast approaching a crossroads.</p>
<p>It is strange how your usual decisiveness deserts you when you really need it. I just couldn’t think and my brain just stopped as if someone had jammed a rod in the gears and cogs in there. Maybe it was panic or worry holding me back. I took a gut call and decided to go to our friend’s place. I still wonder if that was the right decision to make.</p>
<p>Our car had a puncture on the way, but these things had become so normal now, that I almost forgot to mention it and I won’t spare much words describing my frustration.</p>
<p>We spent the day in the gracious hospitality of our friend and his family. The airport was to open at 8:00 AM the next day and we decided to reschedule our flight when the airport resumed operations for sure. We were feeling relieved even though our plans were still somewhat uncertain, perhaps because we were under a roof with good people, a home, even if it wasn’t our own. The cyclone hit Kolkata at night when we were peacefully asleep and it wasn’t able to break our slumber. I guess our exhaustion was stronger than the winds of the cyclone that day. Is it okay to say that I was slightly disappointed with the ‘super’ cyclone?</p>
<p>The next morning came another shattering news- rescheduling was closed for the flights of the previous day and we had to book another ticket each for another flight, the price of which was insanely unreasonable. So was the price of every flight that day. And the next day. I didn’t panic this time. Surprises had become so unsurprising on this trip, I found it to be almost funny.</p>
<p>Here is the part where we finally get lucky - we found three tickets on a train that was leaving Howrah station in an hour and that too at a unbelievably cheap price. We hurriedly packed our bags and got ready to leave in our clothes we had slept in. My friend’s father, who incidentally works in the BSF, arranged a car for us to get to the station, and in a few minutes an SUV, that too with a siren whisked us off to the station. The kind BSF jawans helped us onto the train and finally, after the roller coaster ride, we were on our way to Pune.</p>
<p>Now, as I sit in the train(which is 4 hours late, by the way. Cherry on the cake, isn’t it?), I remember a distinctly memorable moment. As we snaked our way through the narrow lanes of suburban Kolkata, the siren blaring the passers-by out of the way, the cold morning air rushed past my ears and cheeks through the open window and I felt an exhilarating sensation. We were racing against the clock to catch the train, but I was the happiest I had felt that day.</p>
<p>What if we had been on that flight? We would have been eating chicken in KFC at the airport, staring at our phones, lazily awaiting the arrival of our 4 hour flight. I would have reached home the same old way, like many times before. Instead I had battled the circumstances and emerged victorious.</p>
<p>This has started to sound like the exploits of a great warrior and not a travelogue of a tired teenager, so I will stop here.</p>
<p>Onto the next adventure I guess.. :D</p>
