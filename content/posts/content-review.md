In 2020, the amount of time I spent on the internet was probably the highest I have in any previous year and I have consumed a near-unhealthy amount of digital content while being at home for long periods. I thought it would be nice to look back. This is inspired by a recent [blogpost](https://www.xypnox.com/blag/posts/culture-2020/) by [@xypnox](https://www.xypnox.com).

Literature
----------

I read regularly before joining college, but because of involvements on campus and other things to explore, I didn’t read as much as I used to. Without the usual activities on campus, I found more time to read. The guilt of having an unused Kindle lying around at home also contributed ;). Here are some books and pieces of literature I read and liked this year.

-  **Siddhartha** by Herman Hesse
-  **The Stranger** by Albert Camus
-  **The Plague** by Albert Camus (somewhat relatable :P)
-  **Fooled by Randomness** by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
-  **Sapiens** by Yuval Noah Harari
-  **Apollo’s Arrow** by Nicholas Christakis (a very informative book about COVID-19)
-  **Norwegian Wood** by Haruki Murakami
-  **Men without Women** by Haruki Murakami

[This podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44) shifted my approach towards reading from compulsively trying to finish a book regardless of how I find it to only caring about the value I extract from the book. I started caring less about the number of books I read to completion, which I realized was simply a vanity metric, and more about the value I could extract from the book. This, coupled with selecting books based on personal recommendations saved a lot of time and I think I read a greater number of good books.
A great habit I formed was to read a book (a physical one, not an ebook) before bed for at least 15 mins. I found that this really improved sleep quality.

TV Shows
--------

-  **Bojack Horseman** -  This show was hard-hitting. Wit and humor coupled with its dark theme made it a joy to watch. _Bojack_ ended in 2020 and it will probably remain one of the best TV shows I have watched ever.
-  **Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee** - Jerry Seinfeld’s wit even made it worth watching the episodes that had comedians I hadn’t heard of before. I also discovered many great comedians on this show.
-  **Sex Education** - Goofy, funny, and heartfelt at times. A must watch.
-  **Seinfeld** - Classic. Seinfeld episodes were saviors in depressing days.
-  **The Queen’s Gambit** - No words required. Absolutely amazing even for someone who knows very little about chess.
-  **One Punch Man** - While I am not an anime fan, I really liked this one. There is a cleverly hidden and thoughtful message that is conveyed under the funny and action-packed story.
-  **The Last Dance** - Another great limited series that I enjoyed without knowing much about the topic.

Movies
------

-  **Parasite**
-  **Okja** - an underrated film by Bong Joon-Ho.
-  **Bao** - a beautiful animated short film by Pixar.
-  **Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind**
-  **The Truman Show**
-  **Her**
-  **Dallas Buyer’s Club** - absolutely beautiful
-  **The Two Popes**
-  **Primal Fear** - insanely good, must watch!
-  **The Departed**

Comedy
------

I created a separate section for this because I have totally binged Netflix comedy specials in lockdown to beat the stress of the online semester. Some great ones:

-  **Sebastian Maniscalco** - all three of his specials are absolutely hilarious
-  **Dave Chappelle**: Sticks and Stones - legendary
-  **Chris Rock**: Tambourine
-  **Jerry Seinfeld**: 23 hours to Kill
-  **Seth Meyers**: Lobby Baby - insanely good
-  **Anthony Jeselnick**: Fire in the maternity ward - unbelievably witty and dark.
-  **Trevor Noah**: Son of Patricia
-  **Mike Birbiglia**: My girlfriend’s boyfriend

Music
-----

I have totally fallen in love with Classic Rock and indie rock. Since it will be quite tedious to name all the interesting music I have found, I’ll name some artists I enjoy.

Some all-time favorites- Led Zeppelin, John Mayer, Dire Straits, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Tom Petty, Credence Clearwater Revival.
