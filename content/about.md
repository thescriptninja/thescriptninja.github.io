Hi! I am Parth Paradkar. 

I am a final year undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur. 

I love building things, software especially. I am a Python fan with a love for open source software. I am curious about technology and its relationship with human life. 

My DMs are always open to discussions about programming, books and philosophy.
