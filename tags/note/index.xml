      <description>Write Anyways Whenever I think of writing something on my blog, I immediately think about the worth of what I am about to write. For a long time, I believed that something was worth writing only if it was unique and unprecedented. I thought of my blog as a place where people could find something new and meaningful. Under this belief, I shied away from writing about the exciting things and ideas that I had learned about, knowing that there was someone who had already written about it more lucidly and comprehensively than I ever could.</description>

      <description>Dreams During my JEE preparation days, I often fantasized of the independence that lay before me, regardless of where I went after it was over. When it became clear I was to come to KGP, the excitement multiplied manifold as I started imagining the life that lay before me. Most of this excitement lay in the anticipation of making my decisions and choices by myself.
I had always been shielded by my parents in making big decisions.</description>
